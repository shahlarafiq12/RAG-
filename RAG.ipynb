Computer Accessories \\n/circle6Modem \\n/circle6Short for “MODulate/DEModulate”.  The modem sends information from your computer across the telephone system. \\n/circle6The modem at the other end of the phone line, \\nconverts the signal back into a format that can be used by the receiving computer.

Uses of Computer \\nOffice Applications \\n/circle6Automated Production Systems \\n/circle6Many car factories are almost completely automated and the \\ncars are assembled by computer-controlled robots.  \\n/circle6This automation is becoming increasingly common \\nthroughout industry. \\n/circle6Design Systems \\n/circle6Many products are designed using CAD (Computer Aide d \\nDesign) programs to produce exact specifications an d \\ndetailed drawings on the computer before producing models \\nof new products .Uses of Computer \\nOffice Applications \\n/circle6Stock Control\\n/circle6Stock control is ideal for automation and in many c ompanies \\nit is now completely computerized.  \\n/circle6The stock control system keeps track of the number of items \\nin stock and can automatically order replacement it ems \\nwhen required. \\n/circle6Accounts / Payroll\\n/circle6In most large organizations the accounts are mainta ined by \\na computerized system.  \\n/circle6Due to the repetitive nature of accounts a computer  system \\nis ideally suited to this task and accuracy is guar anteed.

Create a Good Working Environment Health & Safety Precautions \\n/circle6Make sure that cables are safely secured \\n/circle6Make sure that power points are not overloaded \\n/circle6Also be aware of: \\n/circle6Repetitive Strain Injury (RSI) \\n/circle6Glare from screens \\n/circle6Bad posture Value of Backup \\n/circle6The most important thing that you store on your computer is information.  \\n/circle6Often the contents of a hard disk can represent years of work.  \\n/circle6If the hard disk stops working one day you could lose all those years of work.  \\n/circle6For this reason it is VITAL that you take regular backups of the information that is stored on the computer. Value of Backup \\n/circle6Organize your computer for more efficient backups \\n/circle6Complete vs. incremental backups \\n/circle6Use \\'off-site\\' storage Value of Backup \\n/circle6Use passwords \\n/circle6Understand the Importance of shutting down your computer properly \\n/circle6Use a UPS (Un-interruptible Power Supply) Likes & Dislikes of Computer \\n/circle6Things computer like :\\n/circle6Good ventilation \\n/circle6Clean environment \\n/circle6Stable, vibration free surface \\n/circle6Things computer don’t like :\\n/circle6Dust \\n/circle6Drinking and eating over the keyboard \\n/circle6Heat, Cold or Moisture \\n/circle6Don’t place objects on top of monitors. \\n/circle6Don’t place floppy disks near monitors. Computer Virus \\n/circle6What are computer viruses? \\n/circle6Viruses are small programs \\nthat hide themselves on your disks (both diskettes and your hard disk).  \\n/circle6Unless you use virus detection software the first time that you know that you have a virus is when it activates.  \\n/circle6Different viruses are activated in different ways.  Computer Virus \\n/circle6How do viruses infect PCs? \\n/circle6Viruses hide on a disk and when you \\naccess the disk (either a diskette or another hard disk over a network) the virus program will start and infect your computer. \\n/circle6The worst thing about a computer \\nvirus is that they can spread from one computer to another, either via use of infected floppy disk, or over a computer network, including the Internet. Computer Virus \\n/circle6How to prevent virus damage \\n/circle6There are a number of third party anti-\\nvirus products available. \\n/circle6Most of these are better than the rather rudimentary products available within DOS and Windows, but of course you do have to pay for them!  \\n/circle6The main thing about your virus checker \\nis that it should be kept up to date.  \\n/circle6Many companies supply updated disks on a regular basis or allow you to receive updates through an electronic, on-line bulletin board. Software Copyright \\n/circle6Be aware on software copyright issues \\n/circle6Freeware \\n/circle6Shareware \\n/circle6What about software that you find on the Internet? \\n/circle6Software site licenses Software Copyright \\n/circle6If your computer system holds information about individuals then you have a moral and legal duty to treat that information with respect. \\n/circle6In a free society you have a right to ensure that information held about you is not abused. \\n/circle6In many countries this right is enshrined under data protection laws Now Let us start our Computers \\nand get going '"
